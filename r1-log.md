The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started over on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R0D0 
Missed days and haven't been keeping track, so I am counting from the beginning to start (and keep) my streak going. Worked on my personal site and github.

### R0D1
Watched FCC video on CSS Grid since I need to drill down on this and really master it. https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac

### R0D2
Worked on redesigning personal website using CSS Grid and adding a sticky header.

# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 0 - Brian Mickey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started over on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R0D0 
Missed days and haven't been keeping track, so I am counting from the beginning to start (and keep) my streak going. Worked on my personal site and github.

### R0D1
Watched FCC video on CSS Grid since I need to drill down on this and really master it. https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac

### R0D2
Worked on redesigning personal website using CSS Grid and adding a sticky header. 

### R0D3
More work on personal site, trying to refine some things and work on responsiveness. Learned more about flexbox and grid, still working on my media queries.

### R0D4
It's official. I spent a long time being frustrated and trying lots and lots of different things and researching, then found I was missing a }. But hey, it works now!

### R0D5, R0D6
Spent a good few hours and learned a few things working on my website and getting it online. 

### R0D7
Made my first commit to using git. Watching some videos and trying to learn some of the basics of using bash, and get in the habit/learn about using version control.

### R0D8
Worked on my FCC Survey page, and used Atom to commit changes to GithHub (which is super easy). I think I will need to make some flash cards or just notes to review to help cement how to do a lot of these particular things. Doing it once for a tutorial and then once for a project doesn't mean I will remember how to do it again (I won't).

### R0D9
Worked on my FCC Survey page, started adding labels and ids. Need to better understand id, name, and label for fields with multiple options.

### R0D10
Went to a meetup for a "Javascript Crash Course" which wasn't what I expected it to be, but I still learned some things and met a few people. Came home and worked on my survey page for FCC, added/fixed my element labels.

### R0D11
Finished my FCC Survey Page, now on to the next project! It's not the prettiest or most functional, but it meets all the requirements and passes the tests. On to the next one.

### R0D12
Started my FCC Product Landing Page, for some reason the tests are not seeing my flexbox or media queries. Maybe I will see what the problem is when I start back tomorrow.

### R0D13
Started adding CSS Grid to product landing page, added video and header image. Feeling good about keeping the streak going and learning from these projects. 

### R0D14
Landing Page passes tests in codepen, so that works. Whenever I try to fix my header when scrolling though, everything goes wacky. More to learn.

### R0D15
Fixed header/nav bar, now passing all tests. Need to finish adding content and polish before moving on.

### R0D16
Finished Jocko Landing Page. Learned a couple more tricks. New project tomorrow.

### R0D17
Started work on Technical Documentation Page, laying everything out based on the user stories and tests.

### R0D18
Completed Technical Documentation Page. Each completed project is making this all a little easier. (Deliberate Practice?)

### R0D19
Started work on the FCC Portfolio project, laying things out based on the user stories and tests. All tests passing, next will be filling out the real content and prettying it all up.

### R0D20
Worked on Portfolio page, didn't get a lot done, hard to focus after a very busy day. Still checked the box and learned.

# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 0 - Brian Mickey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started over on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R0D0 
Missed days and haven't been keeping track, so I am counting from the beginning to start (and keep) my streak going. Worked on my personal site and github.

### R0D1
Watched FCC video on CSS Grid since I need to drill down on this and really master it. https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac

### R0D2
Worked on redesigning personal website using CSS Grid and adding a sticky header. 

### R0D3
More work on personal site, trying to refine some things and work on responsiveness. Learned more about flexbox and grid, still working on my media queries.

### R0D4
It's official. I spent a long time being frustrated and trying lots and lots of different things and researching, then found I was missing a }. But hey, it works now!

### R0D5, R0D6
Spent a good few hours and learned a few things working on my website and getting it online. 

### R0D7
Made my first commit to using git. Watching some videos and trying to learn some of the basics of using bash, and get in the habit/learn about using version control.

### R0D8
Worked on my FCC Survey page, and used Atom to commit changes to GithHub (which is super easy). I think I will need to make some flash cards or just notes to review to help cement how to do a lot of these particular things. Doing it once for a tutorial and then once for a project doesn't mean I will remember how to do it again (I won't).

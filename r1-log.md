The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started over on [August 31, Friday, 2018].

## Log

### R0D0 
Missed days and haven't been keeping track, so I am counting from the beginning to start (and keep) my streak going. Worked on my personal site and github.

### R0D1
Watched FCC video on CSS Grid since I need to drill down on this and really master it. https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac

### R0D2
Worked on redesigning personal website using CSS Grid and adding a sticky header. 

### R0D3
More work on personal site, trying to refine some things and work on responsiveness. Learned more about flexbox and grid, still working on my media queries.

### R0D4
It's official. I spent a long time being frustrated and trying lots and lots of different things and researching, then found I was missing a }. But hey, it works now!
